<p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl species that is originally from India. They
    have
    also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green
    junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
    that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a
    pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
    Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated
    for
    meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

<p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
    2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are
    numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.</p>
